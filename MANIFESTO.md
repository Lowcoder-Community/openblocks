# Lowcoder Manifesto

Dear Community,

We are excited to announce a new initiative to support and extend Openblocks, which unfortunately has been abandoned by its original team. Openblocks has been a critical part of many of our workflows, and we believe it's essential to keep it alive and thriving.

Our team has come together out of a shared passion for the project and a commitment to its principles of openness, transparency, and community-driven development. We are dedicated to continuing the project's legacy under a new name, Lowcoder. Lowcoder remains fully open source, accessible to all, and free from any restrictions or limitations.

As part of our commitment to the community, we will take over all maintenance, bug fixes, and feature development. We plan to prioritize stability and reliability while also introducing new features and enhancements to keep pace with evolving technology.

We will maintain open communication channels, seek feedback, and actively engage with users and contributors to ensure that Lowcoder remains relevant and useful to all. We will be transparent about our development roadmap, progress, and any challenges that arise.

We invite all members of the community to join us in this journey. Whether you are a user, contributor, or developer, your input and support are critical to the success of Lowcoder. Let's work together to keep this essential open source project alive and thriving for years to come.

Sincerely,
The Lowcoder Team
