## üì¢ Use Lowcoder in 3 steps
1. Connect to any data sources or APIs.
2. Build UI with 50+ components.
3. Share with colleagues and customers.

## üí° Why Lowcoder
It's cumbersome to create a single app. You had to design user interfaces, write code in multiple languages and frameworks, and understand how all of that code works together.

Low-code/No-code platforms are fast to get started with but quickly become unmaintainable and inflexible. This creates more problems than it solves.

Retool-like solutions are great for their simplicity and flexibility, but they can also be limited in different ways compared to frameworks like React/Vue.

Lowcoder wants to take a step forward. More specifically, Lowcoder is
- An all-in-one IDE to create internal or customer-facing apps.
- A place to create, build and share building blocks of web applications.
- A domain-specific language that UI-configurable block is the first-class citizen.

## ü™Ñ Features
- **Visual UI builder** with 50+ built-in components.
- **Modules** for reusable (!) component sets in the UI builder.
- **Embed Lowcoder Apps as native React component** instead of iFrame (!). [Demo](https://github.com/lowcoder-org/lowcoder-sdk-demo)
- **Query Library** for reusable data queries of your data sources.
- **Custom components** to develop own components and use them in the UI builder.
- **Native Data connections** to PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, REST API, SMTP, etc.
- **JavaScript supported everywhere** to transform data, control components, etc.
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for granular permission management.
- **Auto-saved and restorable history** for release and version control.

## üèÜ Comparisons
### Lowcoder vs Retool
- Lowcoder is open-source. You don't need to worry about vendor lock-in or being stuck with an outdated version of the software.
- In Lowcoder, developers can create and use their own components instead of depending on official updates.
- Lowcoder is free and you can contribute!
- The EE Version of Lowcoder comes with a much better pricing model, so you have no "per-user costs".
### Lowcoder vs Appsmith, Tooljet
- Lowcoder has more components and richer configuration than Appsmith and Tooljet.
- In Lowcoder, you can choose auto-height or fixed-height mode for your components, while Appsmith supports fixed-height mode only.
- In Lowcoder, you can reuse common structures when building apps with modules and query library features.
### Lowcoder vs Mendix, Outsystems, Pega
- Lowcoder is modern. The codebase is fresh and uses modern standards.
- Lowcoder Apps do not need a compile and deployment. Just publish and use.
- Lowcoder Apps can get embedded natively in websites and apps, even in mobile apps.
### Lowcoder vs internal Tool platforms
- Lowcoder supports internal tools like admin panels perfectly, but also customer-facing apps can get developed and published.
- The Lowcoder UI builder is straightforward and better to use than Bubble.
