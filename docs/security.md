## Does Lowcoder store my data?

No, Lowcoder doesn't store any data returned from your APIs or database queries.

Lowcoder only serves as a proxy between client side and your data sources. When you query your APIs or databases, Lowcoder server connects to the data source with your credentials, forwards the request, and returns the result data to the browser. During the whole process, Lowcoder doesn't store any data from your requests or responses.

Lowcoder also provides a self-hosted version. You can deploy self-hosted Lowcoder images on your own device, on-premise deployment ensures you have total control over your resources and that your data is securely stored.
